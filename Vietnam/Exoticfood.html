            <img src='Images\duong-dua-1.jpg' class="duong">
            <h2>Đuông dừa are the larvae of a bug called the Asian palm weevil, which lives inside coconut trees. It is for this reason that they are most commonly seen in the southern Vietnamese province of Bến Tre, where lush coconut gardens grow.
                Locals consider đuông dừa a delicacy that can be made into a wide variety of dishes, from deep-fried to grilled. Back in 2019, a restaurant in Hanoi even came up with the idea of putting them on pizza as an April Fool prank which caused a storm on the internet.
                But to many people, the best way to enjoy đuông dừa is simply to eat them raw and wiggling with fish sauce. As terrifying as that might sound, these larvae are chewy and have a slightly sweet taste. Wed say that to a certain extent, they are a bit similar to cheese, minus, you know, the squirming part. If you are brave enough to try them this way, youll find that they are actually pretty satisfying to eat.

            <h1>Mắm tôm a staple sauce of Vietnamese households</h1>
            <img src='Images\mam-tom.jpg' class="mamtom">
            <h2>Mắm tôm literally translates to shrimp sauce, and it is made by fermenting shrimp with salt under the sun for months. The method results in a thick sauce with a distinctly intimidating purplish color. But what makes most foreigners wince is the sauces pungent smell, which to many is similar to that of spoiled seafood. For Vietnamese, however, mắm tôm is a staple condiment used in many everyday dishes.
                For instance, it is an indispensable part of bún đậu mắm tôm, a dish favored by many Vietnamese diners where the sauce complements rice noodles, deep-fried tofu, blood sausages, and many other toppings. Chả cá (fish cake) a specialty of Hanoi also uses the strong taste of the sauce to bring out the flavors of deboned fish grilled with turmeric and galangal.

            <h1>Tiết canh (soup made from raw blood)</h1>
            <img src='Images\tiet-canh-1.jpg' class="tiet">
            <h2>Tiết canh, or blood soup, is a Vietnamese dish that consists mainly of raw animal blood most commonly duck or pig blood. It is a way to make the most out of the less meaty parts of an animal, such as cartilage or gizzards, ensuring that nothing goes to waste. To make blood soup, the animal parts must first be cooked and minced. Fresh blood is then poured over them and left to coagulate. The dish is then served with chopped liver and crushed peanuts, as well as a wide variety of herbs.
                Tiết canh is widely eaten all over Vietnam, as people enjoy the feeling of biting through the jelly-like texture of the coagulated blood into the crunchy meat inside. Since the dish is served cold, it is often accompanied by Vietnamese vodka to warm the body up, making it a popular snack during nhậu (drinking) sessions.
                Still, the prospect of eating raw, uncooked blood does turn many heads away, which is why some chefs have created a variation using blended beetroot mixed with gelatin as a substitute for the blood. That could make for a solid alternative if you want to experience this unique Vietnamese dish, but find yourself unable to bear the goosebump-inducing sensation of chewing raw blood.

            <h1>Rươi (brackish water worms that taste absolutely amazing)</h1>
            <img src='Images\cha-ruoi.jpg' class="cha">
            <h2>Chả is a word you’ll see a lot when it comes to Vietnamese cuisine, and it refers to minced meat baked into cakes. Basically any kind of meat can be used to make chả, from chả bò (beef cake) to chả mực (squid cake) and chả cá (fish cake).
                And if you visit markets in some northern Vietnamese provinces such as Hanoi, Hải Phòng, or Quảng Ninh, you might also come across signs that say chả rươi.
                With its extremely savory taste complemented by a hint of citrus, chả rươi can be a main dish on your dinner table, or it can be a yummy afternoon snack provided you are not scared away by its main ingredient, rươi.
                Rươi is a type of worm often found in brackish water in some coastal cities of northern Vietnam. Sure, it’s not easy to bring yourself to eat such frightening creatures, but trust us, one bite is all it takes. Once you see how tasty chả rươi is, you’ll easily forget the worms’ appalling appearance once they’ve been minced and baked into cakes.

            <h1>Sá sùng a luxurious seafood despite its appearance</h1>
            <img src='Images\living-sa-sung.jpg' class="sasung">
            <h2>Yes, the slithery appearance of sá sùng may have you exclaim, “Ew, what on earth is that?”. However, if you’ve tried the famous Vietnamese phở, then chances are you already have a bit of these sea worms in you as some phở restaurants add them to the broth to create a more distinct flavor.
                But don’t sweat it too much. Despite their less-than-appetizing look, sá sùng is an incredibly expensive ingredient, so even the most high-end phở restaurant would only dare use very small amounts of them. Processed sá sùng can sell for as high as VND3,000,000 (~USD130.11)/kg.
                Considered “the king of seafood” by many, sá sùng isn’t something Vietnamese people can enjoy on a daily basis, but aside from being used in phở, it can also be made into a variety of other dishes, from stir-fried delights to stews.
