            <h2>This one infuriates business people all the time as they come to Vietnam with their own ideas about how things should operate. The business culture here isn’t that simple, though. It’s based on trust and reputation; legal documents are fine, but until your new partners know you as a person, there will always be suspicion. Trust takes years to build here and just seconds to destroy – so tread carefully.
            </h2>
            <h3>Nobody wants to lose face
                Vietnamese people care deeply about how they’re perceived by their friends, family and colleagues. Avoid doing anything that will embarrass or diminish a person in public. That could include arguing, ridiculing, confronting or even bartering too aggressively. This is also why you’ll rarely see violent outbursts in Vietnam. Everyone is non-confrontational, because aggression causes both parties to lose face. For the vast majority of minor infringements, a stern glance is enough.
                Academics are revered
                When you speak to students in Vietnam, it can be a bit disheartening to hear how restricted their lives can be – but this is the norm. The job market is competitive, so young people have to be at the top of their classes if they want to succeed. There are amazing opportunities in this booming economy – but only for those who put in the work. That means long school days, with tutors and extra classes at night – especially English, which is now a requirement for many students graduating from higher education.

            <h4>Elders are respected
                After name and nationality, age is one of the first questions you’ll be asked in Vietnam. Their society is built on Confucian beliefs, where experience and wisdom are highly respected. This means the older you are, the more respect you command. You shouldn’t swear or bring up inappropriate topics when you’re with older people, such as death or sex. At dinners, the eldest people are served first – and at home or work, their opinions carry more weight.</h4>
            <h5>Their war history is sacrosanct
                Some people have learned this the hard way: don’t speak ill of Vietnamese war heroes or make jokes about anything related to the war. Generally speaking, Vietnamese people have a great sense of humour, but they don’t joke about the war years. Those were difficult times for everyone in this country. As a foreigner, you need to be careful with this topic and be extremely mindful when speaking about their colonial past.</h5>

            <h1>Transactions are always negotiated
                Shopping in Vietnam is often a battle of subtleties and strategy. Foreigners should expect an extra fee. In this case, your best weapons are your feet. Negotiate with the shopkeeper until they won’t move any more and then threaten to walk away. For most shops, a smaller profit margin beats getting nothing.</h1>
            <h2>Ghosts are real</h2>
            <h3>Many Vietnamese traditions and customs are based around their ancestral beliefs. One of the greatest fears in Vietnam is that the dead won’t find peace in the afterlife – that they’ll be left to wander as tortured spirits. Most people in Vietnam have a ghost story: from a butterfly landing on them during a funeral to strange voices at night. No matter your thoughts on the supernatural, don’t make light of ghosts or the deceased here.</h3>
