            <h2>Vietnam, officially known as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam is a country in Southeast Asia.  Vietnam has land area of approximately 325,361 square kilometers. China is in the north, Laos to the northwest and Cambodia to the southwest of Vietnam. After the reunification in 1975, Hanoi was declared as the capital of Vietnam.
                Vietnamese are descendants of nomadic Mongols and Javas; some are also direct descendants of Cham people. Currently, Vietnam has an estimated population of 93,421,835 as of 2014 census placing Vietnam as the 14th most-populated country in the world.
                According to the Vietnamese mythology, Vietnam was founded by the Hung Kings and became the first rulers of the nation. Until now, the death anniversary of the Hung Kings is still considered as the biggest national event in the country. Several Vietnamese, most especially the ones from the north are still visiting the Hung temples to pay respect and worship the dead kings and mother queens.
            </h2>
            <h3>In 111 BC to 939 AD, Vietnam was under the Imperial China. After the historical Battle of Bach Dang River, a small state in the North grew after successive Vietnamese royal dynasties and national heroes conquered more lands and kept Chinese armies in the border.</h3>

            <h4>The Cham Kingdom was in the South Central of Vietnam then and spreading the knowledge and skills in agriculture for sustainability. To this day, this strategy is still being used and allowing Vietnam to be the top exporter of coffee and rice all over the world.
                During the rule of the last royal Vietnamese dynasty, the Nguyen dynasty, Vietnam fell to French forces and became a colony of French in the mid-19th century same with the neighboring countries like Cambodia, Laos and other Southeast Asian countries. Though Vietnam was then under Nguyen dynasty, Nguyen emperors were viewed as puppets under the French government. Within 80 years, France established its power and conquered the three regions into which the country was then dividedâ€”Cochin-China in the south, An Nam in the central region, and Ton Kin in the north.</h4>
            <h5>One emperor is well known because of his stand about French and other westerners presence in his country; it was the second Nguyen emperor, Minh Mang. He strongly opposed the presence of westerners in Vietnam. He was promoting Confucian belief and teaching and issued a decree prohibiting missionaries in the country. Also due to his strong resistance of offered help from powerful countries like France and America, believing that the country is self-sufficient, Emperor Minh Mang then concentrated on improving agriculture and infrastructure throughout the country.</h5>
